The project will add one additional dwelling unit and one additional off-street parking space. The front setback will not change and the third story will not extend any further into the rear yard than the existing building currently extends. The design of the third story addition will incorporate the design of the existing facade, thereby not changing the character of the existing building nor its relation to the other buildings along the block.
